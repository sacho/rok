1st question
 - leadership needs better communication
 - some stuff about simping and harems and love triangles wtf
Improvements:
 - focus on making decisions earlier so the information flows down faster
 - introduce r4s better! why they're there and what duties they handle, a little meet and greet, alliance mail etc?
 - more communication channels for players to engage with R4s?

2nd question
 - rewards not going to the correct people - data team issue
 - players doing shit rallies
 - bad city rallies and imprison usage
Improvements
 - Data team needs to get their shit together ^_^
 - expand roster of rally leads; try to always use rally leads instead of random rallies
 - city rallies need proper planning and a knowledgable player at the helm; they shouldn't be done just randomly
 - send out an information package to people about how and why to rally(and not to rally) cities in general

3rd question
 - low transparency from leadership
 - many r4s not contributing to war and hiding behind r4 duties?
 - bad attitude by r4s?
Improvements:
 - more flexible wartime communication - warlords should have diplomacy accessible, officers should have a clear tactical plan a few hours ahead laid out in a war channel
 - we need a culture shift if people are afraid of r4s
 - council tickets, just talk to lazzy and flexy if you have an issue? 

4th question
 - communication and transparency issues
 - r4s not knowing what's happening(mge, migration)
 - afraid to talk to leadership about issues
 - strong sense of 'home alliance' vs 'kvk shell'
 - RR/RA perceived as whale alliances
Improvements:
 - spread out gold chest buyers
 - most things covered by the other questions - better transparency, communicating decisions faster
 - use other shells next kvk
Issues with decision making and council:
 - faster decisions require people to step up and propose a plan so we can hit deadlines
 - maybe designate specific people to take charge of a decision; have council give input & act as check/balance
 - MGE needs clear parameters & planning and to be carefully done to avoid unrest
 - people need to step up in council and take charge about a particular thing; use council as check and balance.
 - designate people to be take charge of an individual decision?

5th question
Diplomacy situation wrt 37/36 early in the kvk - how to avoid it happening again
 - faster response times?
 - trust officers more; communicate plans to them, keep from rest of kingdom if needed
Future ally selection based on strength - it looked like we had tried to ally the strongest power kingdoms(29, 47) and make it a boring kvk
Kingdom image - shittalking/looking cocky makes us look bad.
  - repeat offenders should take punishments
  - clearly communicate this in kd rules
  - give warnings & then serious punishments(jail time, lose rewards, etc)
