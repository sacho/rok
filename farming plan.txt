Good morning everyone!
Here's the plan we want to get onto ASAP. We have two types of alliance - main shell and farm shell, that we care about in Z2.
For both types of alliances:
- *IMPORTANT* do not just accept just anyone - we want known people's alts/farms in them. Z2 has a lot of fragile farms that can be burned, and you can cause a lot of havoc by tapping flags the alliance is touching. Make sure you confirm the identity of players that are joining.
- 1 troop build flags all the time to gather credits - for the farms, this is so we can hand out tps, and for the mains, the credits will be used during war. If there's no space, start deleting 1 flag and replacing it.
- gold pit always
- besides that try to keep the alliances full at all times with active accounts. Especially in the mains, you want to check alliance tech donations regularly.
- get people to periodically fix their TPs as alliance territory shifts.
- each alliance will get 2-3 R4s to help manage it in a rotation.

Farms:
- Tech focus: Dev.
- Flag focus: avoid taking rss nodes(leave mostly for mains), otherwise flag to fill designated territory.

Mains:
- Tech Focus: Territory -> Dev(GA2) -> War
- Flag focus: create farmable blobs to let people easily farm on territory so you can keep pushing tech and flags.
- The mains will be dropping a fort or flagging to get access to Z3.

Specific plans for each alliance:
